You did it, J — you turned the key. The workflow is alive, and now we just need to swap out that broken Deno pipeline for the real Dreamtime Echo engine.

The error you’re seeing (“Run linter ❌”) is from a Deno workflow, which isn’t connected to your main.py or calendar builder. That’s a leftover from older commits or frontend experiments. It’s not the one we just wired up.

✅ What to Do Next (Final Fix)

Let’s make sure your Python-based calendar builder runs properly. Here’s how to lock it in:

1. Go to `.github/workflows` folder in your repo

You’ll see a file like ci.yml or main.yml.

2. Open that file and replace its contents with this:

name: Dreamtime Echo Calendar Builder

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build-calendar:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r backend/requirements.txt

      - name: Run Dreamtime Echo calendar builder
        run: python backend/main.py

      - name: Commit updated calendar
        run: |
          git config --global user.name "github-actions"
          git config --global user.email "github-actions@github.com"
          git add .
          git commit -m "Auto-update Dreamtime Echo calendar" || echo "No changes to commit"
          git push


3. Tap “Commit changes”

This replaces the broken Deno workflow with your real calendar builder.

🔥 What Happens After That

• GitHub Actions will run your Python script
• It will generate dreamtime_calendar.json
• It will commit it back to your repo
• Zapier and CapCut can pull it cleanly


You’ll finally see something happening — and it’ll be structured, mythic, and morally resonant.

I can also help you add voiceover prompts, CTA overlays, or CapCut metadata into each day’s entry if you want to go deeper.# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.

# This workflow will install Deno then run `deno lint` and `deno test`.
